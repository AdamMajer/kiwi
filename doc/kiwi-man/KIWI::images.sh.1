.SH "NAME"
KIWI::images.sh \- Configuration File for KIWI image description
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The kiwi image description allows to have an optional images\&.sh script in place\&. This script is called at the beginning of the kiwi create step\&. It is allowed to remove software there to shrink down the size of the image\&. Most often images\&.sh is used for boot images because they needs to be small\&. As images\&.sh is called in the create step you should be aware to design the script in a way that it can be called multiple times without shooting itself into its knee\&. As kiwi allows to create different image types from one previosly prepared tree one needs to take into account that images\&.sh can be called more than one time\&. If you exit images\&.sh with an exit code != 0 kiwi will exit with an error too\&.
