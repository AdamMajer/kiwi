A small boot loader needed for the 'boot from hard disk' menu entry on usb
media. It basically loads the mbr from the first drive that is not the usb
stick.

There's no real need to reassemble; it is already included in
KIWIBoot.pm::addBootNext() in binary form. The code is here mostly for
reference.
